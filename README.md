Our list of features we were able to get to 

```

```

List of features we didn't have time for but would love to see for Waffle.io

```
1. Daily Notifications for users to give updates in regards to assigned tasks - then post those updates on cards themselves
2. Color gradient or labeling tasks that have not been worked on in a while and acquired 'rust'
3. Data visualization and metrics for (Actual Time vs Estimation Time, Time task spends in particular states(in progress))
4. Anonymized voting system to determine task weight 
5. Tree visualization of tasks/project
6. Recommend tasks that have been in a certain state for too long to be broken down into an epic
7. Organize each user's dashboard to show tasks at the top of the column that are relevant to them (i.e. display first all the ones assigned to them at the top)
```

### Tech Stack

We went with fullstack Javascript for quick development using React on the front end and Node.js + Express for our back end. For our real-time features we used smee.io for our webhooks to our github App and sockets.io for our realtime update of our client.
